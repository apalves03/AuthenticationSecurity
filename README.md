Authentication Security
=================

The app allows a two-step user authentication.

On first access, a token is generated for use in Firebase Cloud Messaging and a user registration is requested for authentication.

Afterwards, the defined authentication process starts in the following order:

1 - User login
* Occurs by checking the password that is stored locally in SharedPreferences.

2 - Access code validation
* The app makes a request to the Firebase Cloud Messaging web service with the Retrofit library, then a Push Notification with an access code is sent to the device.
* The user enters the access code or request a new Push Notification, if necessary.

The architecture is MVVM, with dependence injection Dagger and several Android Jetpack libraries.
